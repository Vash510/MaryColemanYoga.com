            <p class="content roboto">I believe that every being matters absolutely. I believe in love. I believe that love - real love, unconditional love, has the power to transform, uplift and give us access to the gifts within us to solve the challenges of 21st century life. I believe that others are worthy of love just because they are.</p>
            <p class="content roboto">I love what I do! I am passionate about helping others to fulfill their highest potential. I have been coaching since 2010 and teaching yoga since 2011.</p>
            <p class="content roboto">I am a Certified Holistic Health Coach (CHHC). I approach coaching with an open mind and use many tools to help clients discover their best and brightest selves. I believe that we need to create harmony in the body to create harmony in the mind and heart. I believe that a clean, whole foods diet that is balanced for each individual is the foundation of any transformation. What we eat influences how we feel. If we eat food that is fresh and whole, prepared in a loving and nurturing way, we will feel loved, nurtured and healthy. I also believe that we need to cultivate harmony in the important parts of our lives: relationships, exercise, social life/relationships, spirituality and the work we do in the world. </p>
            <p class="content roboto">Experience Registered Yoga Teacher (ERYT500)I have taught community based classes of all levels from beginner to advanced. My style of teaching yoga is based in Hatha Yoga of combining movement with breath to gather our scattered energies. I focus on the participant and where they are in the moment to determine what will best serve them. I have taught thousands of hours of yoga and yoga teacher training. I have been honored to have trained more than 200 Central Ohio yoga teachers from beginner to advanced. I am the creator and owner of Cherished Soul Yoga Advanced Yoga Teacher Training. I am an Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher (ERYT-500) with Yoga Alliance (the governing body for yoga teachers). My specialty area is to help others use the gifts of yoga: self-regulation, adaptability and resilience to bring their lives into balance and wholeness. </p>

                    <p class="service-text roboto">Each private or semi-private session is designed for the participant(s). Together we determine the starting point: beginner to more experienced. I teach Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga uses movement combined with breath to collect our scattered energies and restore equilibrium and harmony. Throughout the session(s), I will integrate yoga philosophy, science, gross and energetic anatomy and encouragement to inspire the participant(s).</p>
                    <!--<p class="itallic roboto content">Yoga for Long COVID Symptoms</p>-->
                    <!--<p class="service-text roboto">Long COVID is quite real. There is evidence that yoga can support individuals who are struggling with long COVID. Yoga improves the function of the pulmonary, vascular and cardiac systems. It also affects neurological wellness by helping the individual restore balance to the autonomic nervous system. Yoga improves our ability to move from a stressed state (anxiety, fear, anger, sadness) to a well-regulated state. Yoga will provide you with simple and accessible tools to managing the symptoms of long COVID. Sessions for individuals with long COVID are one-on-one only and are based on current capability. Additionally, for those managing long COVID symptoms, all sessions are on a sliding scale based on financial need.</p>-->

                    <p class="service-text roboto">One-on-one coaching integrates a variety of methods to cultivate whole person health. Working together, we develop strategies to live well, to be healthy and happy. My particular specialty area is helping others navigate through transition (divorce, retirement or when your life just isnâ€™t working the way you want it to!) and/or to identify what they can bring into the community/world to be in service to something greater than themselves. When we are in service to others, we feel happier, kinder and capable. Given the nature of coaching, this is a one-on-one session.</p>

                    <p class="service-text roboto">As yoga teachers it is imperative to continue our learning. Yoga is such a vast study and it can take lifetimes to master! Yoga Alliance has identified five areas of learning for continuing education: Technique, Training & Practice; Anatomy & Physiology (gross/subtle); Teaching Methodology; Yoga Philosophy and Lifestyle; Practicum. I am committed to helping yoga teachers advance their skills and crafts.</p>
                    <p class="service-text roboto">In 2021, I am launching a series of training sessions for yoga teachers to continue their education in a small group format (3-5 participants). These sessions will target: Teaching Methodology, Philosophy & Lifestyle, Anatomy & Physiology (subtle). Participants will receive individual attention within a safe and supportive environment - the way that learning yoga should be!</p>
